## Introduction
The American Sign Language Recognition System is a project aimed at recognizing and translating American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into text. This system leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to interpret ASL gestures, providing a valuable tool for communication with the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.

## Features
- Real-time ASL gesture recognition
- High accuracy with deep learning models
- User-friendly interface
- Docker support for easy deployment

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aayush1693/American-Sign-Language-Recognition-System.git
   cd American-Sign-Language-Recognition-System
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Docker Setup (Optional)
To run the project using Docker:

Build the Docker image:

docker build -t asl-recognition-system .
Run the Docker container:

docker run -p 8000:8000 asl-recognition-system
Usage
Ensure your webcam is connected.
Run the ASL recognition script:
python run.py
The system will start recognizing ASL gestures and translating them into text displayed on the screen.
